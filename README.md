# InsightLink - URL Shortener & Analytics Platform üöÄ

InsightLink is a modern, scalable URL shortening service built with .NET and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate best practices in cloud-native application development, including API design, asynchronous processing, and secure infrastructure management.

## Features ‚ú®

-   [x] **Core API:** A .NET Minimal API for creating and managing shortened URLs.
-   [x] **High-Speed Redirects:** A redirect service that forwards users from the short link to the original URL.
-   [ ] **Asynchronous Analytics:** A decoupled, event-driven backend using Azure Functions and Queue Storage to track click analytics without slowing down redirects.
-   [ ] **User Dashboard:** A Blazor front-end for registered users to view their links and click-through statistics.

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

-   [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
-   [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
-   An active Azure Subscription

### Setup & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd InsightLink
    ```

2.  **Create Azure Resources:**
    This project requires an Azure Resource Group and an Azure SQL Server instance. You can create them via the Azure Portal or by using the Azure CLI.

3.  **Configure Local Secrets:**
    The application uses `appsettings.Development.json` for local development. Create this file inside the `InsightLink.Api` project folder and add your database connection string:
    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "Database": "<your-azure-sql-connection-string>"
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Navigate into the API project folder and run the Entity Framework migrations to create the database schema.
    ```bash
    cd InsightLink.Api
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the API locally from the `InsightLink.Api` directory:

```bash
dotnet run
